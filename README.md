### Key Insights from Walmart Sales Analysis
#### Payment Methods :-

- Three unique payment methods are used: Credit Card, E-Wallet, and Cash.

- Credit Card dominates with the highest number of transactions (4,260) and units sold (9,573), making it the top-performing payment method.

- E-Wallet follows closely with 3,911 transactions and 8,932 units sold, while Cash lags behind with 1,880 transactions and 5,077 units sold.

- On average, E-Wallet provides the highest profit margin per transaction, even though Credit Card leads in volume.

#### Product Categories :-

- Home & Lifestyle and Fashion Accessories consistently generate the highest revenue and profit.

- Combined, these two categories contribute ~80% of the total profit, making them the key drivers of overall business performance.

- These categories also receive higher customer ratings compared to others.

- Food & Beverages, Health & Beauty, and Sports & Travel are purchased in higher quantities, suggesting strong demand but lower profitability compared to top-performing categories.

- Food & Beverages and Health & Beauty show strong profit margins, making them strategically important.

#### Branch & City Performance :-

- There are 100 unique branches across all locations.

- E-Wallet is the most popular transaction method in branches, indicating customer trust in digital payments.

- Weslaco, Waxahachie, and Plano are the top-performing cities, contributing significantly to total sales.

#### Time & Seasonality Trends :-

- Evening (3 to 9 PM) is the peak sales window, both in terms of revenue and transactions.

- Thursday and Sunday are the highest revenue-generating days, highlighting weekend and mid-week spikes.

- Months 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 see the highest sales volume, likely due to holiday shopping. marking it as the prime revenue period


#### Overall Summary :-

- Credit Card drives the highest transactions and units sold, while E-Wallet offers better profit margins.

- Prioritize and promote credit card payment options. Investigate the drivers behind eWallet's high margins for potential replication across other methods.

- Home & Lifestyle and Fashion Accessories dominate profitability and revenue, forming the core business categories.

- Evenings, Thursdays, Sundays, and the holiday season (Novâ€“Mar) are the most critical sales periods.

- Align marketing campaigns, staffing schedules, and inventory stocking to these peak periods. Schedule promotions and flash sales for Thursday and Sunday evenings.

- Conduct a deep-dive analysis into the operations, local marketing, and customer demographics of the top-performing cities (Weslaco, Waxahachie, Plano) to identify best practices that can be applied to lower-performing branches

#### Solving Questins in SQL :-

#### Database Setup & Data Cleaning
- Create database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE walmart;
USE walmart;
```

- Check data types
```sql
DESCRIBE walmart;
```

- Remove $ sign from unit_price
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE walmart
SET unit_price = REPLACE(unit_price, '$', '');
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```

- Modify column data types
```sql
ALTER TABLE walmart 
MODIFY unit_price DECIMAL(10,2);

ALTER TABLE walmart 
MODIFY date DATE;

ALTER TABLE walmart 
MODIFY time TIME;
```

- Add total column (quantity * unit_price)
```sql
ALTER TABLE walmart
ADD COLUMN total DECIMAL(10,2);

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE walmart
SET total = unit_price * quantity;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```

- Data cleaning - remove records with NULL values
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
DELETE FROM walmart WHERE unit_price IS NULL;
DELETE FROM walmart WHERE quantity IS NULL;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```

```python
avg_profit=df.groupby('payment_method')['profit_margin'].mean().round(2).reset_index().rename({'profit_margin':'avg_profit_margin'})
avg_profit
```

#### Compute the profit contribution % of each category relative to total profit.
```python
df['profit'] = df['total'] * df['profit_margin']
